----------------------------------------------

- Docker Integration:
  - Created multiple Dockerfiles for different configurations i.e. api, web and full.
  - Incorporated Dockerfile from pull request by Jesus Raul Jimenez Perez jrauljperez07
  - Packaged different PAIAssistant configurations into seperate Docker images for running locally or in Kubernetes with GPU and non-GPU instances.
  - The Docker images are designed for deployment on Kubernetes environments, with testing conducted on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

- Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
  - Added a buildspec.yml file to ensure compatibility with AWS CodeBuild and CodePipeline. This enhances the project's ability to integrate into automated build and deployment pipelines.
  - Added main.yml for Github Actions. This enhances the project's ability to integrate into automated build and deployment pipelines.

- Licensing:
  - Addressed the original project's ambiguous Creative Commons licensing (CC0 1.0 and CC BY 4.0) by transitioning to the Apache License 2.0 for both PAIAssistantWeb and PAIAssistantAPI.
  - This change aims to clarify the licensing terms and ensure compliance with open-source software distribution practices, as well as compatibility with commercial use and patents.
